# Circle Time

1. Assign someone to be the ‘note-taker’ for that meeting; it is generally recommended that the same person is consistently the ‘note-taker’ for circle time.
2. Conducting circle time
   * Should be starting roughly when everyone is there who had said they’re going to be there is present (Note: don’t wait too long - the purpose is to get into work as quickly as possible)
   * Go over the tasks for the four subsections of the team: Mechanical, Electrical, Programming, and Marketing
   * The note-taker should take notes on what is discussed: progress, goals, and announcements; preferably it’s broken down into the team subsections
3. When circle time is finished ALL members should immediately get to work. The note-taker’s first task should be to make a post in slack\* with the following format.

\*Slack is the communications network the robotics team is using when this documentation is written. Everything should be the same if you’re using another communications network outside of formatting things a bit different.
